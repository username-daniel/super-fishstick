Deploying to OVH with either Supervisor or Systemd involves setting up a process manager to run and manage your application as a service on the server.

Supervisor is a process manager that allows you to monitor and control processes on a Linux server. Here's how you can deploy an application using Supervisor on OVH:

    Install Supervisor: Run the following command on the server to install Supervisor:

csharp

sudo apt-get install supervisor

    Create a configuration file: Create a configuration file for your application in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ directory. For example, if your application is called "myapp", create a file called myapp.conf.

bash

sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/myapp.conf

    Add configuration: Add the following configuration to the file:

javascript

[program:myapp]
command=/path/to/myapp
directory=/path/to/myapp/dir
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=3
stderr_logfile=/var/log/myapp.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/myapp.out.log

Replace /path/to/myapp with the path to your application, /path/to/myapp/dir with the path to the directory containing your application, and myapp.err.log and myapp.out.log with the names of your error and output logs.

    Update Supervisor: Update Supervisor to recognize your new configuration:

sql

sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update

    Start your application: Start your application with the following command:

sql

sudo supervisorctl start myapp

Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. Here's how you can deploy an application using Systemd on OVH:

    Create a service file: Create a file called myapp.service in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service

    Add configuration: Add the following configuration to the file:

makefile

[Unit]
Description=MyApp Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_username
ExecStart=/path/to/myapp
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Replace your_username with your username, /path/to/myapp with the path to your application.

    Reload Systemd: Reload Systemd to recognize your new service file:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    Start your application: Start your application with the following command:

sql

sudo systemctl start myapp

To automatically start your application on system boot, run the following command:

bash

sudo systemctl enable myapp
